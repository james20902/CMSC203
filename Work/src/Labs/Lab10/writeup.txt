Task 2
Function 4 has an intersection at X = .982, and then an asymptote towards 0 starting around X = 3 but then
starts to continually increase at X = 4.

Task 3
Function 5 actually shows to be symmetrical on both sides, with an asymptote towards 0 and seemingly random
noise towards X = 0. Taking a closer look it actually seems like a standard sin function with the frequency
of the wave being controlled by x as a function. After X = -1, 1 though the limit no longer exists as the function
approaches Y = 0.
